Example of contents of options for disks:
shape disks
vertices 8
N 30
Lr 10
th 0.1
tau 10
ar 10
fails_max 100000

vertices is the number of vertices in the polygons which are top/bottom of the
disks

Lr is how much times cubic box edge length is larger than the radius of the
outer circumference of the disk top/bottom.

th is the thickness of the disk, its outer circumference equals to th*ar/2

tau is how much time interface thickness is larger than the thickness of the
disk

ar is aspect ratio

fails_max is maximal number of unsuccessive attempts to add disks into the system
